Citizens Of Bikini Bottom United To Keep SpongeBob SquarePants Off The Road And Out Of Boats All Together.</span></p><p class="pMsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:8pt; line-height:107%; font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Mrs. Puff: Good day, future motorists. I'm Mrs. Puff, </span><span class="spanGramE" style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">state</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> accredited boating instructor. Today, we'll be discussing the differences between a driver with boat smarts... [cut to Squidward in a pilot uniform]</span></p><p class="pMsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:8pt; line-height:107%; font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Squidward: Ripping good day for a spot of driving.</span></p><p class="pMsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:8pt; line-height:107%; font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Mrs. Puff: ...and a driver without boat smarts. [cut to SpongeBob sliding in on his head upside down, next to Squidward]</span></p><p class="pMsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:8pt; line-height:107%; font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward! Look at what I can do with my feet! [wiggles his legs. Squidward gets angry]</span></p><p class="pMsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:8pt; line-height:107%; font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Mrs. Puff: Let's see some examples, shall we? Tire Pressure. [cut to Squidward putting air in his tires] Before you can even think about boating, the boater who uses boat smarts always fills his tires to the appropriate level. [cut to SpongeBob pumping too much air in his tires] While this driver pays no need to boat smarts. [tires </span><span class="spanGramE" style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">flips</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> the boat over. Then the tire explodes and blows air into Squidward's face.] Buckling Up. [cut to Squidward putting on safety belt] As demonstrated by this driver, he has enough boat smarts to use his seat belt and avoid a serious casualty </span><span class="spanGramE" style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">as a result of</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> a collision. [drives off but stops slowly at a stop light] Notice how </span><span class="spanGramE" style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">he comes gently</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> to a stop sign. [cut to SpongeBob driving his boat through town destructively without wearing his seat belt and laughing] Now this driver, with no regard for safety. [Squidward screams as SpongeBob slams into the backend of Squidward's boat, sending him flying into the air still in his seat and buckled up with the steering wheel in his hand. Squidward screams more as he sees a spiky </span><span class="spanGramE" style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">steamroller</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> driving on the road he is flying into. He tries to get his seat belt off but squeezes through the spikes anyways] Well, at least he had his seat belt on. [The boat, now cut in half, comes out of the steamroller and in it is Squidward, all injured. His seat belt pops off.] Adjusting Your Mirrors. What's our boat smarts boater up to now? [Squidward is adjusting his mirrors] You guessed it. He's adjusting his mirror before he begins boating, unlike this degenerate boater. [Beeping sound is heard. SpongeBob is running over citizens while he is adjusting his mirrors]</span></p><p class="pMsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:8pt; line-height:107%; font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">SpongeBob: Ah, perfect.

Oh, that reminds me. I haven't </span><span class="spanGramE" style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">adjusted</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> this one yet.

Can't see! </span><span class="spanSpellE" style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">D'oh</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">! [puts on sunglasses and giggles. Screams as he crashes into a brick wall. Footage from live-action Japanese Crash test dummy is showing with Squidward's head replacing the Japanese dummy's head. He slides out of his seat] Ow.</span></p><p class="pMsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:8pt; line-height:107%; font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Mrs. Puff: Finally, and most importantly, a driver with boat smarts always pays attention to his surroundings and avoids distractions. Notice how this driver's eyes are locked firmly on the road. [Squidward's eyes turn into a lock but vision the road as well. Cut to SpongeBob eating a </span><span class="spanSpellE" style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Krabby</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> Patty and reading the newspaper while driving] And here we have the epitome of a driver who is carelessly distracting himself from the road and safety. [SpongeBob is shaving himself while driving the wrong way on a </span><span class="spanGramE" style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">one way</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> street. Tom is shaking his </span><span class="spanGramE" style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">fist,</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> Norma looks at SpongeBob and Fred shaking his fist in the air. He causes a woman to crash into a streetlight pole]</span></p><p class="pMsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:8pt; line-height:107%; font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Norma: [screams] Jerk!</span></p><p class="pMsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:8pt; line-height:107%; font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">SpongeBob: Hi there!</span></p><p class="pMsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:8pt; line-height:107%; font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Nat: Help! Lunatic driver! [crashes his boat into SpongeBob's but SpongeBob's boat is unharmed and keeps driving.]</span></p><p class="pMsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:8pt; line-height:107%; font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">SpongeBob: How's it going? [He causes many drivers to flip their boats over and get in accidents]</span></p><p class="pMsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:8pt; line-height:107%; font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Fish: [all screaming and talking at once] I can't feel my hair.

[Squidward and Mrs. Puff scream. SpongeBob's boat stops on a rock and tilts upward, causing Squidward's boat to fly up into the air then into the pile of boat mobiles that are in the accident. Mrs. Puff blows up to a big puffer fish]</span></p><p class="pMsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:8pt; line-height:107%; font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">SpongeBob: Looks like you guys forgot your boat smarts!
