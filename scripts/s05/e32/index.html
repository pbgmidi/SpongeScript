We then see these children in colorful uniforms waiting in line for a boat. SpongeBob is seen in the uniform, but has piles of luggage. SpongeBob touches his stuff twice gently, and both times let out a small ding of clean-ness. He then claps his hands like he's playing the cymbals, to get rid of the dirt. We then hear a voice]</span></p><p class="pMsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:8pt; line-height:107%; font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Patrick: SpongeBob!

The children are singing: "Sun Fun Island; get some fun. Sun Fun Island, here we come. Sun Fun Island; to get some fun!" Cries of joy can be heard. Confetti starts falling, and SpongeBob and Patrick are still crying. The children can still be heard singing along to the song. Another boat comes up, but it's metal platted, and doesn't look too friendly. We then see people wearing black and white stripped hats and overalls wearing handcuffs, marching to the boat. They look like prisoners. We then see that it has wires with pointed blades on them at the top, and barred windows. At the entrance, we see this Warden looking out. SpongeBob and Patrick are still crying. They then suddenly give in, and stop crying] Oh, Patrick, if I had only known how hard not saying goodbye could be... [SpongeBob then gets an idea, and we hear the idea bell. SpongeBob yells like he got an idea.

Patrick does the same.]</span></p><p class="pMsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:8pt; line-height:107%; font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Patrick: Weee!

He starts to move his eyes in a swiftly manner, and tosses the stuff to the body of water. He goes in, locks the door with metal bars with pointy ends, and leaves with the stuff on the dock. We then see fog everywhere. We see SpongeBob, up close, looking out on the barred window. The camera zooms out, and we see the boat SpongeBob was suppose to be on] Boy, that looked like a boring boat to be on, huh, guys? [He looks back in the boat, and we see the prisoners. SpongeBob is smiling, but the prisoners are not. They're sitting there, on benches in the middle of the room, with annoyed-mean expression on their face. A light bulb is swinging around in the background] Guys? [We then see lightning strike, and we see their destination: a small island, filled with rocky, pointy-edged, rocks that seem would kill you if you touched it. There's a fort in the middle, with barbed wire at the top, and an open room in the middle. They're all standing there in a corner. We zoom in there, and the door slams opened. We see the Warden go in, and as he comes in, we hear his footsteps, and see the prisons watch in silence, with sweat on their face. We then see the Warden's boots walking towards them. We get a close up of the people, and see all but SpongeBob and Patrick are having that same look. SpongeBob and Patrick have their mouths shaped like an "o," with them looking at the Warden in amazement. We then see a close-up of the Warden's face, and he has a tense expression on his face]</span></p><p class="pMsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:8pt; line-height:107%; font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Warden: Welcome to Inferno Island!

Barney, fetch these two poor hungry souls a snack. On the double! [Barney then comes back and throws tires in front of them. SpongeBob and Patrick look at the tires, and we hear bicycle horns going off. We then see the Warden and Barney, and we hear SpongeBob and Patrick eat the tires.

Well, I know the perfect place for you two to go digest that meal. [We see them smiling, and the bubble transition comes up again. We see them both in a hole in the ground that's shaped like a cube, and with a barred window-like door at the top] A couple days in the hole never hurt anybody. [They close the door, and we go to SpongeBob and Patrick. We see SpongeBob laying on a corpse]</span></p><p class="pMsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:8pt; line-height:107%; font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">SpongeBob: This camp is very upscale! [We then see 3 prisoners carrying a metal tub labeled "chum" on it. At the top, we do see some chum dripping out. We then see the chum has a bone, shoe, and an eyeball in it.

Watch the way they crawl out on their bellies, begging for mercy, and see what's waiting for you, next time you fell up to same way these two did! [Warden looks at them, and notices. We see SpongeBob and Patrick with their body all chunky.

The clock says 9:00, and we then see SpongeBob from the typewriter's point of view, and there are mounds of typed papers. SpongeBob is pushing the typewriter keys one by one, with one finger each. We see the clock again, and it says 7:30. SpongeBob then gets in front of the door labeled "Warden," with his pile of papers in front of him.
