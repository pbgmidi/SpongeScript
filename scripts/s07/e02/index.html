Now, at the </span><span class="spanSpellE" style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Krusty</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> Krab, SpongeBob lifts his leg, and uses his spatula to pick up six patties, and then hops on the wall. He flies up the wall, onto the ceiling, and the gravity forces down the patties onto one big plate with six smaller plates on it, but the patties all land on the same plate. Then, the patties all bounce onto the plate they should be on. SpongeBob walks over to the plate with his hands over his pants as if he </span><span class="spanGramE" style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">has to</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> pee, then he lifts his arm, then his other in a pattern, then twirls around. When he stops, the top buns are on his back. They all fly off, and onto the patties one at a time. The door swings open, and SpongeBob with a smile holds up all six </span><span class="spanSpellE" style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Krabby</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> Patties in one hand with Squidward still watching. Then, he throws the patties up into the air, and starts whistling, walking backwards right then left, then stops when the patties all fly on Squidward's head. SpongeBob's hands are up in the air when one grabs the giant plate. Then, he runs away skipping and varying the plate with one hand again. A scene from the cash register-boat is seen with Squidward's face flat, and then he moans. SpongeBob points to the ground closing his eyes, twirling the plate on one finger. Then, a close-up scene of the plate appears, and all the </span><span class="spanSpellE" style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Krabby</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> Patties fly </span><span class="spanGramE" style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">of</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> the big plate, still on their little ones all to the right customers.

He sticks his tongue out like a dog getting ready to eat it, but a knight falls on it. Then, the entire table collapses. SpongeBob is now seen in front of the door. He is still twirling the plate around on one finger, then he twirls himself around, and he starts to float in the air. He lands in front of another customer's table, and all that is left on the plate is one </span><span class="spanSpellE" style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Krabby</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> Patty. He starts sliding left, then he slides right, and gallops like a sea horse, and </span><span class="spanGramE" style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">jump</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> ropes over the patty once, and </span><span class="spanGramE" style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">falls down</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">. SpongeBob gets back up, and starts moving his legs, and takes his hat off, holding the plate in the other hand. He then holds the patty with two hands for a quick second, and the area where his neck is splits in half marked by the top of his shirt, and the patty slips through the opening. Then, he does that again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and then he jumps up, and uses the patty like a rope to swing back to where he was before in front of the table. He then smiles, and bows causing the patty to slide </span><span class="spanGramE" style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">off of</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> the giant plate, and onto the table]</span></p><p class="pMsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:8pt; line-height:107%; font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">SpongeBob: Your </span><span class="spanSpellE" style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Krabby</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> Patty, ma'am.

He hits the cane on the ground, and then hits Squidward's nose. He takes off the top of the cane, revealing flowers. He put the flowers on Squidward's hat.
