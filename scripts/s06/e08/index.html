SpongeBob is sleeping, and his alarm clock wakes him up, he struggles to turn it off, yawns, then gets out of bed, puts his pants on, then walks into the kitchen to get food for Gary, he accidentally trips because of the heavy bag of food, and there's a big pile of food on top of Gary's bowl.]</span></p><p class="pMsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:8pt; line-height:107%; font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">SpongeBob: Gary, come and get it! [Gary doesn't come to get the food. Outside SpongeBob's pineapple, the wind is blowing and Bikini Bottom looks completely empty] Gary? Gary? Gary? Gary? Gary? [SpongeBob looks in the living room, at the top of the staircase, out of a door at the bottom of the staircase, under his bed, and in the toilet, SpongeBob then walks back into the kitchen] Gary must have gotten an early start. [walks away. cuts to outside where SpongeBob is walking up to Squidward's house with a megaphone] Rise and shine, Squidward! You don't wanna be late again. [silence] Okay, see you at the Krusty Krab. [now talking to himself] I guess Squidward needs his beauty sleep. Not everyone is blessed with my natural good looks. [scene cuts to Patrick's house. SpongeBob knocks on it] Patrick, it's morning! You don't want to forget to wake up again. [silence again] Patrick? Okay, see you after work, sleepy head. [cuts to scene of SpongeBob walking on the street whistling, where nobody else is, SpongeBob hops over a boat that's in the middle of the road, then walks in the Krusty Krab, and stares out the order window, the sun is setting, SpongeBob looks at his watch] Slow day. Good night, Squidward. Good night, Mr. Krabs. [Mr. Krabs' office door opens, revealing that Mr. Krabs is not there. Scene then cuts back to SpongeBob's house] Gary, I'm home! Gary? You here, buddy? [walks into the kitchen, realizing that the big pile of food is still there] Gary? [gasps] He hasn't touched his food! [runs over to Squidward's house screaming, and then knocks on the door] Squidward! Open up! [door opens by itself] Squidward, have you seen Gary? He's gone missing! [no answer] Squidward? Not a sign of Squidward anywhere. Squidward? [walks upstairs] You up here? Hmm, Squidward's clarinet. [puts the clarinet in his mouth a few times] It's not even warm. Squidward's missing, too! [runs over to Patrick's house] Patrick, open up! Squidward and Gary are missing! [lifts up rock, revealing that there's nobody there] Patrick's gone, too. What if everybody's gone?! [cuts to the Krusty Krab] Mr. Krabs! [gasp] He's gone, too! [cuts to Sandy's house] Sandy! She's gone. [cuts to SpongeBob walking out of five buildings, saying "Gone" each time he exits one, he then runs forward on the street, hyperventilating] Where did everybody go?! [we look around Bikini Bottom, then we see the whole city, where SpongeBob is doing the echo effect on a cliff] Go? Go? Go? Everybody's gone! But I swear that I will keep the memory of Bikini Bottom alive, by living out their lives for them. [cuts to next day, where SpongeBob is blowing a bubble of himself, then plays a record of him laughing, he then runs into Squidward's house, takes the form of Squidward and imitates him] SpongeBob, will you be quiet? You're disrupting my genius. [plays off-key notes on Squidward's clarinet. Bubble transition to the Krusty Krab] Mr. Krabs, sir, can I have a raise? ""[SpongeBob then sits in Mr. Krabs' chair and takes the form of Mr. Krabs and imitates him] No! Now get to work! [as SpongeBob] Yes, sir, Mr. Krabs, sir! [Bubble transition to SpongeBob taking the form of Old Man Jenkins and imitating him] Excuse me, sonny, may I have a Krabby Patty Deluxe please? [as Squidward, with SpongeBob's normal voice] Right away, sir! [imitates Squidward] I mean... whatever. Hey, SpongeBob, we got an order for a Krabby Patty Deluxe. Heaven knows why. [giggles in normal SpongeBob, then moves a box that looks like him] Coming up, Squidward! [Bubble transition to SpongeBob at Patrick's house where he looks like him and is sleeping and snoring in Patrick's form. Bubble transition to Sandy's house] Excuse me, Sandy, but may I have some more of this delicious iced tea? [as Sandy] Why sure! Whoops, just a sec. [grows a tail] Why sure now, SpongeBob. [Bubble transition to Mrs. Puff's Boating School, SpongeBob as Mrs. Puff] Good morning, class. Can anyone tell me the first thing you do when riding a boat? [as SpongeBob] Ahem, floor it? [as Mrs. Puff] That's right, you floor it. Excellent work, SpongeBob! [as SpongeBob] Why thank you, Mrs.... [sadly] Pu... Pu... Puff! [starts to cry] This is pointless! I'm no Mrs. Puff! I can't replace everyone! I'll never be happy again! [notices a stack of blank driver's licenses on the desk] Ooh, my driver's license! [cuts to SpongeBob, taking a picture of him to put in the license] That's the baby. [he then walks up to a boat] Hi, fella, it's me. [boat drives away, SpongeBob then pulls it back up] It's okay, I'm licensed. [SpongeBob gets in the boat and starts it up] Oh yeah, listen to that purr! La-la-la- [SpongeBob starts driving it around Bikini Bottom causing destruction] -la-la-la... [he falls asleep, and drives into Patrick's house, causing it to skid up, missing Squidward's house, and then crashes into the top floor of SpongeBob's house] Good night, Boaty. [is then having nightmares, and is talking in his sleep] No! No! [wakes up and screams] No! [pants] Oh, Gary, I had a nightmare that all my friends were gone! And I was driving a-! [screams, cause he notices that Boaty is right next to him in bed] So it was true! I... guess it's just you and me now, Boaty. [scene cuts to him and Boaty taking a shower, then eating cereal, then crashing out of the pineapple riding it, then jellyfishing, then at the Goo Lagoon, then on the seesaw, then driving into the Krusty Krab] This is where I work. Do you want to help me cook up some Krabby Patties? Great! [SpongeBob puts a box of Krabby Patties under Boaty's tire, then moving it to get the patties on the grill] Back when everyone was around, they used to enjoy these. Here, try one. [throws a Krabby Patty under his hood, it then splatters everywhere] What? You don't like Krabby Patties? Huh! Well, I guess we can still make this work. [scene cuts to SpongeBob driving Boaty into the pineapple] Whew. Boy, we learned a lot about each other today. You know? I thought I'd go crazy without all my friends and acquaintances around, but it looks like you were all I needed to stay sane! [Boaty rumbles] What? A puppet of my old best friend? [Boaty rumbles again] Made entirely out of Krabby Patty Meat? [laughs] Oh, Boaty, you are a card. [SpongeBob walks into a closet, where he is talking to the puppet Boaty was talking about earlier] Sorry I'm late, Patrick. Boaty was telling me a joke.
