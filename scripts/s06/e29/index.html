[camera directs on three of them individually] ...and they're better than mine! [starts sniveling, crying, and whimpering, sits down on the rug, and starts rocking himself] He even got the rug right. Get a hold of yourself, Squiddy, old bean. This doesn't mean anything. [touches the rug] This...all of this is just... [smiles] Mimicry! He doesn't possess your style, or your decorating acumen, or your love of the finer things. In fact, the only thing that he has is... is... my vacuum cleaner! And I'll remedy that...

He picks it up] It is you! [kisses it] Come on, baby. You and I will walk out of this horror show the way we walked into it: with dignity and aplomb.
